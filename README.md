# ID-card-generator
Developed a simple web-based ID Card Generator where users can input their details, upload a photo, and generate an ID card. The project also includes an option to download the card as a PDF. This project helped me practice form handling, file upload, and basic PDF generation using web technologies.  Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.
